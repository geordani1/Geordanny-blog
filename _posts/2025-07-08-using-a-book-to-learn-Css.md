In this post I will explain why I chose books instead of going all-in on other learning resources like courses or YouTube videos.

## Why not a course or a tutorial?

It really depends on how you want to learn, but in general, a good short video explaining something is usually enough for most problems. But sometimes what you want—as in my case—is to go as deep as you can, and I think a book and good documentation are a very solid starting point for this. Of course, I'm going to be using all the available tools like AI, YouTube, and maybe a blog like this one whenever I feel stuck or don't understand something. Another reason is that I want to improve my reading comprehension and writing as well. Reading more is really handy because I'm learning multiple things at the same time.

## What book am I using?

</div>

### CSS IN DEPTH

To be honest, I haven't read it completely yet, so I don't have a meaningful opinion about it apart from the fact that the cover is pretty. But judging by the title, the introduction, and the first chapter, I can say it is exactly what I'm looking for.

### How to get this book?

I'm using the O'Reilly Learning program, which offers many books for free through the [Online Resources](https://www.bpl.org/popular-online-resources/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of the [Boston Public Library](https://www.bpl.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. As far as I know, there are many other libraries that offer access to these resources for free, but you can also buy it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/CSS-Depth-Second-Keith-Grant/dp/1633437558/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12MIE0A1PCTGP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EWLpP-hbFLuacDc6c_odR5FbXAHw7okCiyWuiZ9Db1s-c8mdxbI30TSUuaLlIKic.sMmAuFqywEF3sJpRXufbF0OsBqQYoSlBmgTn4jwQpdU&dib_tag=se&keywords=css+in+depth&qid=1752001798&sprefix=css+in+depth+%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or on the official [publisher website](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## Am I going to be posting things about CSS?

I'm 100% sure that I'm going to be posting the things I find interesting in this book. My plan is not to replace the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} about CSS, rather I just want to focus on those "coconut oil" features that can be hard to remember but are handy to know.

## Have I tried to learn with books before?

Yes, but only once. It was *Python Crash Course, Third Edition*, which you can read for free using this [link](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It has two main parts: one where it teaches the fundamentals of the language, and another where you apply everything you have learned by creating projects. It is a good book and also free. This book helped me get a better understanding of Python without going deeper into more advanced "pythonic" features.

## Am I reading other books?

Yes! Recently I started reading [The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It's a very interesting book, similar to [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-James-Clear-audiobook/dp/B07RFSSYBH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MO2A8C0SK9RU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.f40BjO3UpSUHUPMm8WsQZL9U_H6QS5M6BNTJZPXWpCTswBq6n69508wd7BEc67092m_xDClmIZOC-fkg7qy8U6LA8l0dyXzMyhosNAOREJN73ip54bHZqEw2ywWllLqOOzSRmGj7W3Z-LqKEpueZki2yI1C0cHPFhdoQf32xDbia7hTPfo30ZnjEerb7EMX2LSjpuRu8wTelj3q2gzqh3PWbMCUHXwpie8VJmRC0UH4.T3QggZ_5gAk9Cmx3F6lsPUpZMtu9WNwp5Ty8KEOzERg&dib_tag=se&keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1752004289&s=books&sprefix=Atomic+habi%2Cstripbooks%2C101&sr=1-1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but I decided to read *The Power of Habit* first because I associate *Atomic Habits* with "be your own boss" and "shark mentality," and I've already listened to the audiobook. That's why I decided to read *The Power of Habit*. My plan is to write only about this book and how I'm implementing the things I read in it in my personal life, and how they can change things for me. I'll probably read *Atomic Habits* in the future, but for now my interest is in *The Power of Habit*.

## Conclusion

That's everything for now. I probably won't be able to publish more posts for a few days or even weeks due to the amount of things I have to learn and study, but I will make sure to have some posts prepared for the future, and why not an extended version of this one.
