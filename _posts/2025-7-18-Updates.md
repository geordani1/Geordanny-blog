### My experience with CSS

CSS ended up being something I only skimmed instead of diving deep. I learned the fundamentals—how to center a div and how to use Flexbox and Grid—but nothing more. At first I was determined to master the language, yet I quickly realized that reading an entire CSS book wouldn’t help if I forgot most of it a week later. As Albert Einstein (supposedly) said, *“Never memorize something you can look up.”* In my case, it would read: *“Never memorize something you can check in the documentation.”* That doesn’t mean memorization is useless; it’s just that knowing what to memorize is more important than memorizing everything. Right now, becoming a CSS wizard isn’t my top priority, so—like any good politician—I’m not doing what I promised I’d do. I hope that’s for the best.

### What I’ve been using to learn recently

I’ve been following **The Odin Project**. I finished the Foundations course and chose the Ruby path because it feels comfortable. I love the idea of object-oriented programming, and I think Ruby will help me build small projects—maybe even videos—later on. It will also be useful for maintaining and customizing this blog.

### I injured one of my feet

It’s nothing serious, but I couldn’t walk properly. One day I limped twenty minutes to campus in 91-degree heat and still had to go back later. That’s life, and I’m not complaining. I can’t control the weather, the injury was my own fault, and the decision to go was mine. The swelling has gone down with ice and exercises. The only downside is that I missed my English conversation group, but I’ll catch up next week.

### Reason for this post

I just want to keep the habit of writing here so it can serve as a progress log. I won’t force myself to publish a fixed number of posts in a set timeframe; at the moment this post has no purpose other than being an online diary.

### Starting college in September

Classes begin in September, and I’m excited to dive deeper into computer science—and to have an excuse to buy more tech books.

### Conclusion

Lately I haven’t been at peak productivity, but I feel I’m still making progress, and that’s what truly matters. I’ve completed a few projects on my GitHub, using AI to help with anything I didn’t understand. I’m happy with the results. Even when motivation dips or I have to do things I’d rather skip, I keep going—trying to stay realistic yet positive.
