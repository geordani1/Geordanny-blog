## Who Am I?
Hihihihihi, I'm Geordanny, a 20-year-old currently enrolled in a Computer Science Associate Degree program at Northern Essex Community College in Massachusetts, USA. I am originally from the Dominican Republic, and I moved to the USA in 2024.

## What Am I Going to Write About?
My plan is to write about my life and learning journey, share my experiences with programming, and talk about things I learn along the way (like music, language, and more).

## Why Did I Decide to Start a Blog?
I realized that it's hard to keep track of everything I learn, especially when it comes to sharing it with others. That's one of the reasons I decided to start this blog. Another reason is that I want to improve my writing skills by writing more often, and I think this is a great way to do it.

## Topics I Expect to Write About
- Programming (Python, JavaScript, C)
- Arduino (electronics and electricity)
- Artificial Intelligence
- Cybersecurity
- Music (guitar and maybe other instruments in the future)
- Language learning
- Personal development
- Books and movies

## Why So Many Topics?
I have a serious problem with focusing on just one thing, so I'm always changing my mind about what I want to do, but I like to learn new things even if I don't learn them deeply.

## Conclusion
I hope you find something useful in my blog. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to contact me through my LinkedIn or email.
