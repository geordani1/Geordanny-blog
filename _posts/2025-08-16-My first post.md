HI HI HI HI HI there!!!!, I'm geordanny, right now I'm a student at [Northern Essex Community College](https://www.necc.mass.edu/){:target="_blank"} doing an associote degree in computer science, and in this blog I'm gonna be sharing all the silly things I think, do, and study. I really hope you find something interesting/funny/stupid here.

some question that nobody asked:

# Why I Decided to Create This Blog?
I thought it would be a good idea to have a place where I can share my learning progress and another things in general. It’s also a great way to challenge myself to better understand what I’ve learned by just talking about in the internet, while also improving my English writing skills.

# Why study computer science when everybody is saying that AI will take all our jobs?
The main reason why I chose computer science is simply because I like it. I think this kind of things should decided just by feeling rather what other people say.

# How often am I going to make posts?
I expect to post just once per month, or maybe twice, it depends on "no idea", so let's see.

### Conclusion:
That's all for now! I'm excited to share more things, like books I'm reading, and my college journey. I would also like to share a bit about my personal interests in the future without going too deep into private matters bye bye and thanks for reading. I love you!!
