Hello, I'm Geordanny and I'm currently pursuing an associate degree in computer science at [Northern Essex Community College](https://www.necc.mass.edu/){:target="_blank"}. In this blog, I'm going to be sharing things related to the program and other topics I'm passionate about in technology in general. Now I will answer a few questions about this blog below:

# Why I Decided to Create This Blog
I thought it would be a good idea to have a place where I can share my journey and the things I learn along the way. It’s also a great way to challenge myself to better understand what I’ve learned by writing posts about it, while also improving my English writing skills.

# Why study computer science when everybody is saying that AI will take all our jobs?
The main reason why I chose computer science is simply because it is what I have always liked, and I would say it is a topic that I just enjoy studying. Regardless of what the future holds, I believe that understanding technology will always be valuable.

# How often am I going to make posts?
I expect to post just once per month, or maybe twice, it depends on what I'm doing at the moment.

### Conclusion:
That's all for now! I'm excited to share more things soon about what I'm learning, books I'm reading, and my college journey. I would also like to share a bit about my personal interests in the future without going too deep into private matters.
